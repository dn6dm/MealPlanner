<h3 class="mt-3">About this website</h3>
<p class="text-muted">The MealPlanner website is for anyone looking to regulate their caloric and macronutrient intake
    more thoroughly. From Weight Watchers to the Keto diet, there are an endless number of different diets and meal
    plans. These diets all differ in principles and approaches but the most important thing is whether or not you can
    stick through with it. Most people often fail to follow through with their diets because it is way too different
    from what they usually eat or cook and takes too much effort to maintain. The MealPlanner website seeks to create
    healthier diets that users can actually keep up with and maintain long-term.</p>
